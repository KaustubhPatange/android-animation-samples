# Spring Back RecyclerView

A sample to show how we can implement a spring back functionality for Recyclerview.

When you fling the `RecyclerView` & it reaches either end or to the top of the list the remaining velocity will be dispersed to create this _Spring_ like animation.

<img height="420px" src="art/demo.gif"/>

_Animation is playing at 0.5x_

## Usage

This is not a library but a sample build for an article that I wrote on medium (see below). TBH, this is just my take on how the animation have been applied.
